    This style sheet uses media queries to implement a responsive design.
    At the top level there are several media queries that generate
    layout breakpoints for specific screen widths.

          mobile phones in portrait, and everything else.

/*
    The rules within this media query are for smartphones, typically in
    portrait mode. They also serve as default rules if not overridden by
    rules within other media queries.
    Note: This media query is not really necessary, but I like to have
    it around so that all rules in this style sheet are indented on the
    same level.
