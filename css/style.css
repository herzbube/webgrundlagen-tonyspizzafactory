            According to W3Schools the flexbox display mode is supported only

            all other solutions that I tried for vertically centering the text

                width: 50%;
                height: 50%;

            2) The table method:

                top: 0;
                left: 0;
                width: 50%;

            3) And other things that I cobbled together myself and that are not
